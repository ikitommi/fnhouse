# Contributing

Contributions to fnhouse are very welcome.  

Please file bug reports on [GitHub](https://github.com/prismatic/fnhouse/issues).

For questions, feature requests, or discussion, please post on the Plumbing [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prismatic-plumbing) for now.

Contributions are preferred as GitHub pull requests on topic branches.  If you want to discuss a potential change before coding it up, please post on the mailing list.

Fnhouse is relatively well-tested.  Before submitting a pull request, we ask that you:

 * please try to follow the conventions in the existing code, including standard Emacs indentation, no trailing whitespace, and a max width of 95 columns  
 * rebase your feature branch on the latest master branch
 * ensure any new code is well-tested, and if possible, any issue fixed is covered by one or more new tests
 
To run the tests, run `lein test :all` in the root directory of the project.
